# Probability of logical disjunctions

All other rules of probability theory can be derived from the two basic rules.
So take two logical propositions $A$ and $B$.
The logical disjunction of $A$ and $B$ is the logical proposition ($A$ or $B$).
In our notations we write $A + B$ for ($A$ or $B$)
We can deduce from the basic rules of probability that:

$$
p(A + B|I) = p(A|I) + p(B|I) - p(AB|I).
$$

In words, this says

> The probability of A or B is the probability that A is True plus that probability that B is true minus the probability that both A and B are True.

This is very easy to understand intuitively by looking at the Venn diagram.
{numref}`venn-diagram`.
The probability $p(A+B|I)$ is the area of the union of A with B (normalized by I).
This area is indeed the area of A (normalized by I) plus the area of B (normalized by I) minus the area of A and B (normalized by I) which was double-counted.

Let's see a formal proof of this:

$$
\begin{split}
p(A+B|I) &=& 1 - p(\neg (A+B)|I)\\
&=& 1 - p(\neg A, \neg B|I)\;\text{(obvious rule)}\\
&=& 1 - p(\neg A|\neg B, I)p(\neg B|I)\;\text{(product rule)}\\
&=& 1 - \left[1 - p(A|\neg B, I)\right]p(\neg B|I)\;\text{(obvious rule)}\\
&=& 1 - p(\neg B|I) + p(A|\neg B, I)p(\neg B|I)\\
&=& 1 - p(\neg B|I) + p(A\neg B|I)\;\text{(product rule)}\\
&=& 1 - p(\neg B|I) + p(\neg B|A,I) p(A|I)\;\text{(product rule)}\\
&=& 1 - p(\neg B|I) + \left[1 - p(B|A,I)\right]p(A|I)\;\text{(obvious rule)}\\
&=& 1 - p(\neg B|I) + p(A|I) - p(B|A,I)p(A|I)\\
&=& 1 - \left[1 - p(B|I)\right] + p(A|I) - p(B|A,I)p(A|I)\;(\text{obvious rule})\\
&=& p(A|I) + p(B|I) - p(B|A,I)p(A|I)\\
&=& p(A|I) + p(B|I) - p(AB|I)\;\text{(product rule)}.
\end{split}
$$
